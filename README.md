# CellularLife

This project had the intent to simulate particle life with a simple set of rules.
The algorithm used to simulate the particles was based off the ones used by Martin Novy in his creation
Althouh Adjusted and applied in a different way, this project has the same goal: to use little particles with simple rules to create a larger structure that mimics cells found in nature.
